# Todo

- Allow user to guess using keyboard
- Add Sentry to track front-end and API errors.
- Handle errors gracefully (e.g., when using `useGetWordQuery`)
  - Network errors (e.g., API is down, API returned response that JS didn't expect.)
  - Handle type errors (e.g., reading property of undefined)
  - *I should probably write a post about this so I can make sure to always deal with these errors in every app.*
- Add favicon
- Show an actual stick figure being hanged.
